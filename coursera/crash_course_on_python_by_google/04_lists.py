# While lists and strings are both sequences, a big difference between them is that lists are mutable.
# This means that the contents of the list can be changed, unlike strings, which are immutable. You can add, remove, or modify elements in a list.

# The skip_elements function returns a list containing every other element from an input list, starting with the first element. 

def skip_elements(elements):
	# Initialize variables
	new_list = []
	i = 0

	# Iterate through the list
	for i in range(len(elements)):
		# Does this element belong in the resulting list?
		if i % 2 == 0:
			# Add this element to the resulting list
			new_list.append(elements[i])
		# Increment i
		i += 1

	return new_list

print(skip_elements(["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g"])) # Should be ['a', 'c', 'e', 'g']
print(skip_elements(['Orange', 'Pineapple', 'Strawberry', 'Kiwi', 'Peach'])) # Should be ['Orange', 'Strawberry', 'Peach']
print(skip_elements([])) # Should be []
